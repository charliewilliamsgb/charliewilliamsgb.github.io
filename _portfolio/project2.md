For my second mini project, the main objective was to utilize Airbnb review data to uncover actionable insights and potential business opportunities aimed at enhancing guest experience. To begin I had to convert the downloaded CSV dataset into a MySQL database using Python to allow for the analysis to take place. The analysis focused on identifying specific keywords in the reviews like "hot," "cold","uncomfortable," and "noisy" to pinpoint areas of concern.

Reviews mentioning "hot" pointed to a need for improved air conditioning systems, while "cold" reviews indicated a demand for heating solutions. Furthermore, "uncomfortable" reviews highlighted hosts who required possible furniture upgrades, and "noisy" reviews presented an opportunity for soundproofing. Python and SQL served as the primary tools throughout the project, and the data was sourced from "Inside Airbnb". By addressing guest comfort issues expressed in reviews, the project offered leads for businesses who offer cooling and heating solutions, furniture and soundproofing.
