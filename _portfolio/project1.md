For my first personal mini project, I wanted to address an existing challenge for someone I know. They are a devoted Hartlepool United fan who struggles with modern technology but wishes to keep up with the latest news surrounding the club. To simplify this for them, I developed a program that utilizes technology they're familiar with and brings them the latest news.

Written in Python, this program uses the SerpAPI, a web scraping tool, to collect the top 5 news stories about Hartlepool United from the past day. It organizes these stories into a daily digest and sends them directly to the user's email address. The program is scheduled to run at 9:20 AM every day, perfectly matching the user's morning routine, so they can enjoy the latest news with their breakfast.
