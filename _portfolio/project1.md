For my first personal programming project, I wanted to address a real-life challenge for someone I know. They're a devoted Hartlepool United fan who struggles with technology but wishes to keep up with the latest news about their favorite club. To simplify this for them, I developed a special tool tailored to their needs.

Written in Python this program utilizes the SerpAPI, a web scraping tool, to collect the top 5 news stories about Hartlepool United from the past day. It organizes these stories into a daily digest and sends them directly to the users specified email address. The program is scheduled to run at 6:30 AM every day, perfectly matching the users morning routine, so that they can enjoy the latest news with their breakfast!
